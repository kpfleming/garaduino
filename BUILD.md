# Configuration, Build, and Installation

## Bootstrap

In order to configure Garaduino, three items will be required:

* MAC address - a MAC address will need to be selected or created
for the Ethernet interface. The Ethernet Shield may have a MAC
address included on a printed sticker; if not, any MAC address
can be used as long as it does not conflict with any other device
on the network.

* Password - the OTA upload process uses a username/password
combination to authenticate the uploader. The username is fixed
as 'arduino', but the password can be any string of characters.

* IP address - Garaduino assumes that the network will use DHCP
to provide an address, and since the address will be associated
with the MAC address it will be obtained after the board has been
bootstrapped.

To get started, launch the Arduino IDE, connect the Arduino to the
computer over USB, and open the OT_Ethernet sketch.

1. Click File->Examples->ArduinoOTA->OT_Ethernet.

1. Enter the MAC address in the line which begins with `byte mac[]`.

1. Enter the password in the line which contains `ArduinoOTA.begin()`,
replacing the existing `password` string.

1. Click the Upload button on the toolbar to compile and upload the
OT_Ethernet sketch to the board.

1. Click Tools->Serial Monitor to launch the monitor tool in a new
window, which will display the output generated by the sketch.

The Arduino will boot, connect to the network, obtain an IP address,
display it, and then wait for an OTA firmware upload. Make a note of
the IP address.
